# Zeef #
Zachary's Framework (Zeef) is a C# game framework built for Unity.

## Setup ##
* This project requires a higher version of C# that Unity regularly uses. To enable the higher version of C# you must change the Scripting Runtime Version setting from Stable to Experimental
  * This setting is found at Edit => Project Settings => Player => Other Settings => Configuration => Scripting Runtime Version

* This Framework also relies on AsyncAwaitUtil which can found here: https://github.com/svermeulen/Unity3dAsyncAwaitUtil/releases
  * Make sure this is in the Plugins folder within the Assets folder along with Zeef
