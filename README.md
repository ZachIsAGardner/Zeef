# Zeef #
Zachary's Framework (Zeef) is a C# game framework built for Unity.

## Setup ##
This project requires minimal setup to get working.

###### Step 1: Scripting Runtime Version
* This project requires a higher version of C# that Unity regularly uses. To enable the higher version of C# you must change the <strong>Scripting Runtime Version</strong> setting from <strong>.Net 3.5 Equivalent</strong> to <strong>.Net 4.x Equivalent</strong>
  * This setting is found at Edit => Project Settings => Player => Other Settings => Configuration => Scripting Runtime Version

###### Step 2: AsyncAwaitUtil Extension
* This project also relies on the <strong>AsyncAwaitUtil</strong> extension which can found here: https://github.com/svermeulen/Unity3dAsyncAwaitUtil/releases
  * Make sure this is in the Plugins folder within the Assets folder along with Zeef
