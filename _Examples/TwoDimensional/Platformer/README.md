## Map Editor
To use Map Editor...
* Select and lock Map gameobject.
* Select a tile from the selection near the bottom of the inspector.
* Select a "layer" to place tiles under.
* Press the appropriate keys to interact with the scene.
    * The default keys are...
        * e) Place tile (Deletes any tile at position before placing anything)
        * d) Delete tile
        * f) Pick tile (This will set whatever your cursor is over as the current tile to place)
    * Keep in mind these actions will only work with tiles in your currently selected layer
